# Perfect-Project


Bai lives in an empty, white room, and wants to decorate it to make it look perfect, and to fend off her anxieties, materialised as cocoons and webs.



Walkthrough:

You start in a white room. To the left of Bai is the catalogue, and to the right is a mirror.
The catalogue has a total of 9 items. Click on the price tag, and the description box below the catalogue will show a description, and then you can buy it. 
The mirror can be clicked on to show Bai in her current state. There are 5, and each time a new state is reached, the mirror opens automatically

All the items except the mirror has a 'idle' and 'broken' state. When an item breaks, a panel appears
Either drag the darker item into its corresponding area or double click an area on the panel to 'fix' it.

Drag and Drop: 
Closet: drag the shirt into the closet, upper left side
Plant: drag to the right side of the flowers
Clock: drag into the L shaped area
Origami: drag onto the string

Double Click: (the hit box area is quite large)
Music Box: click the lever of the box
Candle: click the upper area
Bookshelf: click the fallen books
Whiteboard: click lower left corner

Fixing items give you money.


Enemies:
There are the webs which slowly appear around Bai, and black cocoon ropes drop from the ceiling.
The ropes fall apart easily. Either click them or pull them down, and they will fall onto the floor and disappear after a while.
The webs have 5 stages. Buying an item resets the webs to the start of the stage it is on. Fixing and pulling down cocoons sets them back a little.

Pulling down cocoons give you money.




Breakdown:
The mirror, now to the far right, can still be clicked on
All the items except the mirror can be thrown. 

Clicking on the items shows a dialogue box. I recommend clicking on them several times, to show all the lines.




Ending:
Click on the mirror to show an animation
